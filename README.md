# TwitterLoginForm
First few views when Twitter App is launched for first time including Launch Animation 

if you change return method isLoggedIn to true you will be presented with HomeController instead of login walkthrough

It uses pods, so u first need to install them and after open xcode workspace.
App uses SwiftRealm also for persistent data but this is my first app using them so everything it is under development.
You can use this as template for something else, just strip down the code :)

Bellow are some pic from iPhone 4s device
